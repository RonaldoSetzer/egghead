# Adding cypress to an existing project in order to start writing e2e tests

Joining a new project is always quite a challenge, how do we contribute to a new codebase without breaking things?

At some point in project's live, adding e2e (end-to-end) tests becomes a life-saver.

In this lesson we're going to learn how to install cypress and add it to a pre-existing project so we may start covering the codebase with automated e2e tests.
